## Abstract

Machine learning technologies have been proven to provide the best solutions
to healthcare problems and biomedical communities. It also helps in the early
prediction of the disease. Symptoms of the disease can be controlled, and proper
treatment of the disease can be done due to the early prediction of the disease. The
number of deaths due to heart attacks is increasing exponentially. Thus, machine
learning approaches can be used in the early prediction of heart disease. Different
supervised machine-learning techniques like K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes,
support vector machines, neural networks, random forest classifier, decision tree
classifier and the gradient boosting classifier are used for predicting heart disease
using a dataset that was collected from the University of California, Irvine (UCI)
Machine Repository. Among all other supervised classifiers, the results depict that
the Random Forest Classifier was better in terms of performance metrics like
accuracy, precision, and sensitivity.
